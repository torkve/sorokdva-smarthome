# Torkve's Code of Conduct 1.0 (TCoC-1.0)

1. We as members, leaders, and contributors accept contributions from any humans:
   our experience clearly shows, that most contributions are done by humans so we
   have to state that there's nothing wrong to be a human.
   
   * Proposals from cats are accepted as well. Average code written by cats is
     better than code wrriten by humans.
   * Our community is rather inclusive, so other life forms should be tolerated
     as well.
     
2. Our main priority is to write code FTW.
   
   * Nobody cares about your gender, race, religion, as long as you write good
     code.
   * If you are hitler, or if you are killing kittens, you are definitely a
     bastard. But as long as your make good PRs, they would be accepted, as
     they redeem your guilt a little. A little.

3. We encourage (but not force!) you to adapt this TCoC to other projects:
   * it is simple
   * it is really tolerant and inclusive
   * it is all about doing things better rather than multiplying hatred,
     cruelty and bans.
   * the copy of this Code of Conduct and any later versions can be found in
     its own repository: https://github.com/torkve/torkve-code-of-conduct
